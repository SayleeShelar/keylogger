# Keylogger

This is a simple keylogger application implemented in Python using the `tkinter` library for the GUI, `pynput` for monitoring the keyboard inputs, and `datetime` for timestamping the keystrokes.

## Features

- Captures keystrokes and saves them to a log file (`keyfile.txt`).
- Supports recording key combinations (e.g., Shift + a).
- Provides a basic GUI for starting, stopping, and clearing the log.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies (`tkinter` and `pynput`).
3. Run the `keylogger.py` file to start the keylogger.
4. Use the GUI buttons to control the keylogger (start, stop, clear log).

## Disclaimer

This keylogger is intended for educational purposes only. Please use it responsibly and ensure that you have the necessary permissions before monitoring someone else's keystrokes.
